    <h2>Important Announcement: The New Literacies Alliance Has Retired</h2>
    <p>After 15 years of volunteer-driven collaboration, the New Literacies Alliance (NLA) project has officially retired. This decision was not made lightly, but the current budget environment no longer allows us to continue hosting the server and maintaining the platform at no cost. As such, please note that direct technical support for the lessons will no longer be available.</p>
    <p>We are deeply grateful to the educators, librarians, and institutions who have supported and used NLA lessons over the years. To ensure continued access and adaptability, we have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Created <a href="{{ "/assets/docs/nla-IMSCC-export.zip" | relative_url }}">IMSCC files of all lessons</a> for easy import into learning management systems.</li>
        <li>Uploaded all lessons to Canvas Commons, where they remain freely available. (<a href="{{ "/assets/docs/NLA_Lessons_Import_Instruction_Sheet.docx" | relative_url }}">Download Instructions</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We fervently hope that you will continue to use, adapt, and build upon these resources to meet your unique instructional needs.</p>
    <p>Please note: Some lesson components - such as embedded YouTube videos or content hosted on external servers (e.g., Kansas State University) - may not remain available indefinitely. These elements are beyond our control and may change or disappear over time.</p>
    <p>The remainder of this site - and all associated pages - will be preserved as an archive, reflecting the final state of the project and celebrating its legacy.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being part of this journey.</p>

    <h3>Welcome to the New Literacies Alliance</h3>
    <p>The New Literacies Alliance is a dynamic curricular project led by <a href="{{ "/about-us/" | relative_url }}">librarians from multiple institutions</a> across the United States.</p>
    <p>Our purpose is to address the new literacies needed for academic success and lifelong learning.&nbsp;In our lessons, students master skills at their own pace using our cutting-edge online learning platform.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;<a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="{{ "/available-lessons/" | relative_url }}">our lessons</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;are free Open Education Resources, you can use and adapt as you see fit.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Review some</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="{{ "/using-lessons/popular-sequences/" | relative_url }}">suggested sequences</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.

    <p>Our hope is to work with other institutions to create a curriculum, built on the ACRL Information Literacy Framework (and related) standards, that&nbsp;helps all students start at the same level for library and research instruction.&nbsp;Discover how you can&nbsp;<a href="{{ "/about-us/join/" | relative_url }}">help support the effort</a>.</p>
